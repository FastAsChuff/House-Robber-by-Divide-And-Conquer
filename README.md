# House-Robber-by-Divide-And-Conquer
This program solves the 'House Robber Problem' using a divide and conquer technique. 
Each house on a street has an amount of money stashed in it, and the robber wants to steal as much as he can in one night. 
However, the houses have connected security which alerts the police if adjacent homes are burgled. 

This program finds an optimal selection of houses to rob without alerting the police. 
The houses are given a random amount of cash each.
